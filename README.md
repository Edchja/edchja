My name ist Edgar and I'm currently in my second year of my apprenticeship as a software developer.

I am experienced in:
- Java
- Go
- HTML & CSS
- MySQL
- Docker

I'm looking forward to learn more about that in the future.

In my spare time I learn new stuff, take pictures or I'm training in the Gym. ðŸ’ª
